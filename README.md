# gipgee

The Gitlab Image Pipeline Generator (Enhanced Edition)

## Work in progress
The current version of Gipgee is only able to release itself, the project is currently under development. I already implemented a tool like the gipgee for my daytime job, but now I want to rebuild it from scratch as open source project - thats the reason why this is the "enhanced edition".

## What will Gipgee be?
The Gipgee will be a tool for dynamically creating container image build and update pipelines for gitlab, based on a yaml configuration.

In most companies I worked for you often have the problem that your container (base) images are build by a pipeline in GitLab, pushed to the registry and then it remains there untouched and without updates. Often there is no time to maintain the images and apply proper quality checks for container images. The Gipgee tries to solve this problem for you, if you are using GitLab.

Gitlab has a feature called [dynamic child pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/parent_child_pipelines.html#dynamic-child-pipelines). Dynamic child pipelines are pipelines that can be created by a job in your pipeline and then be triggered. Here, the Gipgee comes in. You can commit a gipgeee.yaml configuration file which describes how to build your container image - which base image has to be used, which target locations you want to upload the image to and which tests you want to perform in the image before releasing it. After committing this yaml file and your Containerfile (for most people known as Dockerfile) you can run the Gipgee in your pipeline. The Gipgee will then genereate a child pipeline, based on the supplied yaml file which performs one of the following tasks:
* Rebuild the images
* Update Check

### Rebuild the images
The image rebuild pipeline will be created in different ways, depending on the surrounding context. 
#### Manual trigger
If you manually trigger the pipeline for your default branch, then a build pipeline for all images defined in the gipgee.yaml will be created. The first job of each image build job chain will be set to `when: manual`, which means that you have to click "play" on the corresponding job.
You can force a start of all jobs when triggering a pipeline for the default branch by defining the env var `GIPGEE_FORCE_AUTOSTART=true`. The pipeline will createt and test a staging image, and then release it.
#### Feature branch
In a feature branch, the gipgee will check which files have been changed in the branch and then build all images that have a matching `watchedAssets` configured in the gipgee.yaml. The pipeline will create and test a staging image, but not release it.

### Update Check
The update check pipeline parses your `gipgee.yaml` and then creates update check jobs for the corresponding images. All images defined in the `targetLocations` will be pulled and update checks will be performed. The update check consists of two jobs.
#### The Skopeo layer check
The skopeo layer check checks which layers the base image used for the given image has been configured. It downloads all layer infos (only the layer ids from the manifest, which is really lightweight) and check if the current image is still based on the base (by checking if the base image layer ids are the same as the first layer ids of the current image). 

#### The container image update check
The container image update check is a command you can implement on your own. It will be called and should write the update check result to a update check result file - the name of this file will be supplied.
The best thing the image update check command can do is in most cases:

* List the installed packages (e.g. by calling `dpkg -l | sort`), save the result to a file (e.g. `result-a.txt`)
* Perform package updates (e.g. by calling `apt-get update && apt-get -y upgrade`)
* List the installed packages (e.g. by calling `dpkg -l | sort`), save the result to a file (e.g. `result-b.txt`)
* Compare the list of installed packages. If they differ, yield that as status to the given update check result file.


### Update build pipeline
After the gipgee has processed the results of the update check pipeline, it will trigger an additional image rebuild pipeline which
only rebuilds the images that have updates. The goal here is to be as resource efficient as possible and not to swamp your with unnecessary image registry.
